Code samples CLIPS 


CLIPS (http://www.clipsrules.net/) is a somewhat _ancient_ expert system tool. Since it's dated, there aren't that many resources on the web. I put my stuff here so it might be beneficial for people who are interested or in need of help.

In `TOH.clp` you can find how to code an iterative (instead of recursive) solution to play Tower of Hanoi in CLIPS. The idea is from Brachman & Levesque (2013) p.133.  I believe my solution is relatively short.
