Code samples CLIPS 


CLIPS (http://www.clipsrules.net/) is a somewhat _ancient_ expert system tool. Since it's dated, there aren't that many resources on the web. I put my stuff here so it might be beneficial for people who are interested or in need of help.

In `TOH.clp` you can find how to code an iterative (instead of recursive) solution to play Tower of Hanoi in CLIPS. It works on any number of disks (up to 32,768) with three pegs. I believe my solution is fairly short. The idea is from Brachman & Levesque (2013) p.133.
